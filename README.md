#Introduction

The [Public Knowledge Project](http://pkp.sfu.ca) has a large amount of documentation for it's suite of scholarly publishing software. A lot of this documentation lives on the [PKP Wiki](http://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page). As part of the code sprint at the 2015 PKP Conference – and a general effort at migrating documentation to something more fluid and open *and* because GitBook supports translations – it seemed logical to migrate content to GitBook (Github).

Hilariously, it also seemed appropriate to add to this mountain of documentation with a document on how to migrate documents. 

**This GitBook isn't so much about how to use GitBook as much as it should provide some simple guidelines for migrating existing content from the Wiki – *or beyond* – into GitBook.**

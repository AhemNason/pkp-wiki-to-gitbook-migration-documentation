#Common Issues

Here's some things you'll probably see happen. Heads up.

* Pandoc ignores mediawiki boxes: \{\{warning| ...\}\}
* Pandoc does automatic linebreaks... but has a "no wrap" option for formatting (see pandoc --help). 
* code block text converts poorly, may require cleaning up.
* GitBook will break your heart, repeatedly.

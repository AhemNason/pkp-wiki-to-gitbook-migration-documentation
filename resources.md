Converting documentation *can* be very simple, if the planets align. Here are a few things you'll hopefully find handy in your conversion adventures. 

**[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)** // Pandoc is a text conversion tool run via command line. It's especially great because it can convert many formats to Markdown (and Markdown is the language used by GitBook). And it's *especially* great because the PKP Wiki is in mediawiki format and it can convert mediawiki to Markdown. 

**[GitBook](http://www.gitbook.com) | [Github](http://github.com)** // A GitHub account isn't necessary to have for editing or creating a GitBook, but you can tie the two accounts together for a little more flexibility. It is worth noting that **GitBook has it's own rich documentation about [how to use GitBook](http://help.gitbook.com/)**. It's definitely recommended that you read that. 

**[Markdown Skills](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)** // Markdown is essential here, but you're in luck because it's **super easy**. Markdown is a simple syntax-based markup language that is easily readable by people and can be converted to all sorts of beautiful other formats. There's two common formats. [Basic Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [GitHub-Flavored](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).

You also might appreciate a Markdown editor of some kind. Some include:

- Atom
- Sublime Text
- TextMate
- ByWord
- Draft
- GitBook's built-in editor

 
While a discrete editor is by no means necessary, they can be convenient for drafting documents locally before adding them to a document.

You'll likely also benefit – maybe in general, as a person – from a positive attitude and a large cup of coffee.

Converting documentation *can* be very simple, if the planets align. Here are a few things you'll hopefully find handy in your conversion adventures. 

[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) // Pandoc is a text conversion tool. It's especially great because it can convert many formats to Markdown (and Markdown is the language used by GitBook). And it's *especially* great because the PKP Wiki is in mediawiki format and it can convert mediawiki to Markdown.

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) // Markdown is a simple syntax-based markup language that is easily readable by people and can be converted to all sorts of beautiful other formats. There's two common formats. [Basic Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) and [GitHub-Flavored](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/). 

You also might appreciate a Markdown editor of some kind. Some include:

- Atom
- Sublime Text
- TextMate
- ByWord
- Draft
- GitBook's built-in editor

 
While a discrete editor is by no means necessary, they can be convenient for drafting documents locally before adding them to a document.

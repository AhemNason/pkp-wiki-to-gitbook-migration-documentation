#Updating Documentation

There are two methods to update or add content to GitBooks currently. 

**Option 1: Getting Added to the PKP Organization in GitBook** // You can contact Kevin Stranack to request permission for editing content within GitBook itself. This is the simplest method for making changes to documentation. 

**Option 2: Fork the Git Repo Associated with the GitBook and Submit a Pull Request with Your Changes** // This method gives users an opportunity to make changes without a GitBook account or association within the PKP Documentation group. However, the decision to merge your changes will rest with whoever created the repo.
